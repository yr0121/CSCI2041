### Assessment for Homework 01

Below are the automated scores for Homework 1.  If you feel that our scripts are incorrectly assessing your work then please email ``csci2041@umn.edu`` and explain the problem.  If your code is right you will get credit for it - just maybe not right away.

Please note that a manual assessment of your code will also be made to look for opportunities for partial credit. Specifically, we will be looking for work that looks close to working but still fails all the tests. There will be some partial credit for that kind of work.

#### Total score: _135_ / _150_

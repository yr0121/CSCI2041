## Introduction

This is the manual assessment for Hwk_05 (not including extra credit). You
should also have an automated assessment, `Hwk_05_Assessment.md`, in your
repository. A manual assessment for the extra credit will appear within a week
after the extra credit due date, if applicable.

Note: If you received full points for a problem and your grader left no
comments, you get an animal fact. ([Source](https://www.mnn.com/earth-matters/animals/blogs/36-random-animal-facts-that-may-surprise-you))


## Part 1: Evaluating expressions by hand

### Question 1

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check for name and Internet ID.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by value evaluation.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by name evaluation.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check lazy (call by need) evaluation.

#### Comments

Young goats pick up accents from each other.


### Question 2

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check for name and Internet ID.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by value for `andr`.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by name for `andr`.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by value for `andl`.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check call by name for `andl`.
+ _3_ / _3_ : Check for statement on which evaluation is most efficient and why.

#### Comments

A single strand of spider silk is thinner than a human hair, but also five times stronger than steel of the same width. A rope just 2 inches thick could reportedly stop a Boeing 747.


## Part 2: Efficiently computing the conjunction of a list of Boolean values

+ _6_ / _6_ : Check if `ands` avoids examining the entire list unless necessary.

### Comments

Fourteen new species of dancing frogs were discovered in 2014, raising the global number of known dancing-frog species to 24.


## Part 3: Implementing Streams in OCaml

### 3.1 ``cubes_from``

No manual assessment for this objective.

### 3.2 ``cubes_from_zip``

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `cubes_from_zip` uses `zip`.

### 3.3 ``cubes_from_map``

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `cubes_from_map` uses `map`.

### 3.4 ``drop``

No manual assessment for this objective.

### 3.5 ``drop_until``

No manual assessment for this objective.

### 3.6 ``foldr``, ``and_fold``, and ``sum_positive_prefix``

+ _3_ / _3_ : Check if `foldr` has the correct type annotations.
+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `foldr`'s type includes `lazee`.
+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `foldr` has exactly two input arguments.
+ _10_ / _10_ : Check for comment explaining `foldr`'s type and how it works.
+ _5_ / _5_ : Inspect `foldr` function definition.

#### Comments

Nice job

#### ``and_fold``

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `and_fold` uses `foldr`.

#### ``sum_positive_prefix``

+ _1_ / _1_ : Check if `sum_positive_prefix` uses `foldr`.

### 3.7 The Sieve of Eratosthenes, "``sieve``"

#### The ``sieve`` function

This inspection is mostly for partial credit if your `sieve` function does not
work for the automated tests. You will lose points here if your `sieve`
definition exhibits conceptual errors, is hard to understand, or is missing.

+ _10_ / _10_ : Inspect `sieve` function definition for partial credit.


## Turning in your work

As mentioned in the homework protocol, this part of your score is based on your
code quality.

+ _10_ / _10_ : Writing transparent code.

### Comments

Well done

## End of Manual Assessment

**Total score: _76_ / _76_**

Add this score to your total for automated tests in `Hwk_05_Assessment.md`. The
sum is your score for Hwk_05 (out of 100).

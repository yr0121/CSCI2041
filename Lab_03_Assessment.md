    OCaml file "lab_02.ml" has no syntax or type errors.



+ Pass: Check that an OCaml file "lab_02.ml" has warnings.

    OCaml file "lab_02.ml" has no warnings.



#### Your functions should all still work, but let's check to be sure.

+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `circle_circum_v1 2.5` matches the pattern `15.70`.

   



+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `circle_circum_v2 2.5` matches the pattern `15.70`.

   



+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `product [2; 3; 4]` matches the pattern `24`.

   



+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `sum_sqrdiffs [4; -1; 5; 2]` matches the pattern `70`.

   



+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `distance (1.2, 3.4) (4.5, 5.6)` matches the pattern `3.9`.

   



+  _1_ / _1_ : Pass: Check that the result of evaluating `triangle_perimeter (1.0, 2.0) (3.0, 4.0) (5.0, 1.0)` matches the pattern `10.55`.

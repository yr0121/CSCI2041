**Changelog:**
+ Friday, February 23: (Sean) Initial version.


## Introduction

### Checking the basics...

+ Pass: Change into directory "Hwk_02".

+ Pass: Check that file "trees.ml" exists.

+ Pass: Check that an OCaml file "trees.ml" has no syntax or type errors.

    OCaml file "trees.ml" has no syntax or type errors.



+ Pass: Check that an OCaml file "trees.ml" has warnings.

    OCaml file "trees.ml" has no warnings.



## Part A

### Sanity check: Can we make a tree?

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   (Leaf 5)
   ```
   matches the pattern `(Leaf 5)`.

   




+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   (Fork ("Hello",
       Leaf "World",
       Leaf "!"))
   ```
   matches the pattern `(Fork ("Hello",
       Leaf "World",
       Leaf "!"))`.

   




_Other sensible sanity checks: A tree which contains two forks, a string tree, ... maybe a tree of trees?_

### Let's try out your functions:

#### 1. ``t_size``

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_size (Fork ("Hello",
       Leaf "World",
       Leaf "!"))
   ```
   matches the pattern `3`.

   




#### 2. ``t_sum``

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_sum (Leaf 5)
   ```
   matches the pattern `5`.

   




+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_sum (Leaf (- 5))
   ```
   matches the pattern `-5`.

   




#### 3. ``t_charcount``

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_charcount (Fork ("Hello",
       Leaf "World",
       Leaf "!"))
   ```
   matches the pattern `11`.

   




#### 4. ``t_concat``

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_concat (Fork ("Hello",
       Leaf "World",
       Leaf "!"))
   ```
   matches the pattern `"HelloWorld!"`.

   




## Part B

Just like in Gradius, you'll find options quite useful.

       Leaf (Some "World"),

Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_opt_sum (Leaf None)
   ```
   matches the pattern `0`.

+ Pass: 
Check that the result of evaluating
   ```
   t_opt_charcount (Fork (Some "Hello",
       Leaf (Some "World"),
       Leaf None))
   ```
   matches the pattern `10`.

   




#### 4. ``t_opt_concat``
